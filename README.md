A minimum working example of the analysis is presented under `defect_analysis/sample_analysis.m`. Also of interest is `defect_treatment_study/diamond_test_analysis.m`, which analyses the diamond NV center dataset used in the paper, as well as `defect_treatment_study/monte_carlo_num_defects.m`, which runs all the simulations used in the paper.
